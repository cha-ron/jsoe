The `jsoe` (JavaScript Object Explorer) script allows commandline exploration
and validation of JSON structures.

A primary goal for this script is full support for piping: the output of a call
to `jsoe` piped into another call should be identical to a single call given a
concatenated path argument.

To install, run `pip install [directory]`, or `pip install .` inside this repo.
